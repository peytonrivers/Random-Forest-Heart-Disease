# Random-Forest-Heart-Disease
### In This project I learned about using Random Forests and it's features to be able to optimize it's accuracy rate. I was able to feature engineer my model by using features like max depth, estimators, and used min_weight_fraction_leaf to limit the splitting of a node.

### This project was a very successful project for me because I got to be able to modify the original random forest function to increase the model's accuracy from 77.1% to 79.6%.

### This is a step in the right direction for me in my continuing pursuance of becoming a data scientist. I can't wait to continue to learn different types of functions and models to become the best data scientist possible.
